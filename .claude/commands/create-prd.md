# Create Product Requirements Document (PRD)

You are tasked with creating a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a feature or project.

## PRD Structure

A well-structured PRD includes:

### 1. Overview

**Product Name:** [Feature/Project Name]

**Version:** 1.0

**Date:** [Current Date]

**Author:** [Name/Team]

**Status:** Draft | In Review | Approved

**Executive Summary:**
1-2 paragraphs summarizing:
- What is being built
- Why it's important
- Expected impact

### 2. Problem Statement

**Current Situation:**
Describe the existing problem or opportunity:
- What pain points exist?
- Who is affected?
- What's the business impact?

**User Needs:**
- What do users need?
- Why do they need it?
- What alternatives are they using?

**Example:**
```markdown
## Problem Statement

Users currently struggle to export their data from the platform. They have
to manually copy-paste information or take screenshots, which is:
- Time-consuming (30+ minutes for 100 records)
- Error-prone (manual entry mistakes)
- Frustrating (users complain in 15% of support tickets)

Business impact: We lose ~5 customers per month to competitors who offer
export functionality, representing $60K ARR.
```

### 3. Goals and Success Metrics

**Business Goals:**
- What business objectives does this support?
- Expected revenue impact
- Cost savings
- Market positioning

**User Goals:**
- What will users be able to do?
- How will their experience improve?
- What problems will be solved?

**Success Metrics (SMART):**
- **Specific:** Clearly defined
- **Measurable:** Quantifiable
- **Achievable:** Realistic
- **Relevant:** Tied to goals
- **Time-bound:** Deadline specified

**Example:**
```markdown
## Goals and Success Metrics

### Business Goals
- Reduce customer churn by 2% (from 5% to 3%)
- Decrease support tickets related to data access by 50%
- Increase user satisfaction score from 7.2 to 8.0

### User Goals

### 6. User Stories

Write user stories in the format:
**As a [user type], I want to [action], so that [benefit]**

**Examples:**
```markdown
## User Stories

### Must Have
1. As a data analyst, I want to export filtered data to CSV, so that
   I can analyze it in Excel or Python

2. As a business manager, I want to schedule weekly exports, so that
   I have fresh data without manual effort

3. As an admin, I want to see who exported what data, so that I can
   audit data access for compliance

### Should Have
4. As a power user, I want to save export templates, so that I don't
   have to configure the same export repeatedly

5. As a mobile user, I want exports emailed to me, so that I can
   access data on my phone
```

### 7. User Experience (UX)

**User Flows:**
Describe step-by-step how users will interact:

```markdown
## Primary Flow: Basic Export

1. User clicks "Export" button on data table
2. System shows export dialog with options:
   - Format selection (CSV, JSON, Excel)
   - Date range picker
   - Column selector
   - Preview (first 10 rows)
3. User configures options and clicks "Generate Export"
4. System shows progress indicator
5. System generates file and shows download button
6. User clicks download and receives file
7. System shows success message with file details

## Alternative Flow: Scheduled Export

1. User navigates to Export Settings
2. User clicks "Schedule Export"
3. System shows scheduling form:
   - Export configuration
   - Frequency (daily, weekly, monthly)
   - Delivery method (download, email)
4. User saves schedule
5. System confirms and shows next run time
```

**Wireframes/Mockups:**
Include sketches or descriptions of key screens:
